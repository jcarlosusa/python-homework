Read the Data
Complete the following:

Read in menu_data.csv and set its contents to a separate list object. (This way, you can cross-reference your menu data with your sales data as you read in your sales data in the coming steps.)

Initialize an empty menu list object to hold the contents of menu_data.csv.

Use a with statement and open the menu_data.csv by using its file path.

Use the reader function from the csv library to begin reading menu_data.csv.

Use the next function to skip the header (first row of the CSV).

Loop over the rest of the rows and append every row to the menu list object (the outcome will be a list of lists).

Set up the same process to read in sales_data.csv. However, instead append every row of the sales data to a new sales list object.
